Buddhist tradition describes three styles of compassionate leadership: the trailblazer, who leads from the front, takes risks, and sets an example; the ferryman, who accompanies those in his care, sharing the ups and downs of the crossing; and the shepherd, who sees each one of his flock into safety before himself. What these approaches have in common is an all-encompassing concern for the welfare of those they lead.
